## Attended Automation within Zohoâ€™s helpdesk environment
**Objective** <br>
The process will automate the creation of help desk tickets using data from an Excel sheet.<br>
Once the bot is invoked, it will check whether there are new request files available to process. If available, the bot will read the ticket data from the spreadsheet. The data is used to create support tickets in the Zoho Desk application.
