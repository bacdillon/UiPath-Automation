Test automation is the process of executing test cases automatically using software tools. In automation testing, the goal is to reduce the time and effort required for manual testing to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the testing process. Many types of testing activities can be automated, including functional testing, regression testing, and performance testing.

## Data Driven Testing with form status
**Objective** <br>
Data-driven testing, test workflows and applications across various scenarios. Ensure test cases use the prepared test data, debug and run data-driven test cases only from the Test Explorer panel.
