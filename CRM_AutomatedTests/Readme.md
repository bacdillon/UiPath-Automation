Test automation is the process of executing test cases automatically using software tools. In automation testing, the goal is to reduce the time and effort required for manual testing to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the testing process. Many types of testing activities can be automated, including functional testing, regression testing, and performance testing.

## Test Case Summary

| Feature              | Azure DevOps Work Item | UiPath Test Case Name                   | 
|----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Login (Valid)        | User Story 1           | `TC_001_UserCanLogin`                   | `/TestCases/AccountLogin/TC_001_UserCanLogin.xaml`     |
| Login (Invalid)      | User Story 2           | `TC_002_UserCannotLogin`                | `/TestCases/AccountLogin/TC_002_UserCannotLogin.xaml`  |
| Logout               | User Story 3           | `TC_003_UserCanLogout`                  | `/TestCases/AccountLogin/TC_003_UserCanLogout.xaml`    |
| Create New Customer  | User Story 4           | `TC_004_UserCanCreateNewCustomer`       | `/TestCases/Customers/TC_004_UserCanCreateNewCustomer.xaml` |

## Data Driven Testing with form status
**Objective** <br>
Data-driven testing, test workflows and applications across various scenarios. Ensure test cases use the prepared test data, debug and run data-driven test cases only from the Test Explorer panel.

## This is a simple Test Case 
Verify that user is able to login successfully into the ACME System 1 web application by entering valid credential. 

This how to perform the execution of the test cases in the UiPath. This can also publish the same project in the Orchestrator or Test Manager (a web application that allows to easily manage testing processes. This application is hosted by the Test Management Hub) and from the steps create the test sets and schedule the executions from their just like the other activities such as Test Data Queues.
